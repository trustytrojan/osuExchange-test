# osuExchange-test

## To begin testing:

Create the virtual environment first:

```
python -m venv .
```

Enter the virtual environment:

- On Windows: `Scripts\activate`
- On Linux: `source bin/activate`

Install osuExchange in the virtual environment:

- To install from PyPI: `pip install osuExchange`
- To install from a local osuExchange repo, run the `reinstall-osuExchange.sh` bash script. It will check `..` for `osuExchange`, make sure it's there, or edit the script to your needs.
